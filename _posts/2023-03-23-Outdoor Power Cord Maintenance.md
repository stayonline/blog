Whether you own a marina, run outdoor events, use temporary power, or run generators, it's important to inspect your outdoor power cords for corrosion, cracking, fraying, and other problems. Here's what you need to know to ensure your electrical equipment is in top condition for the season ahead.

First and foremost, it's important to inspect all outdoor power cords for any signs of damage. This includes checking for corrosion, cracking of the insulation, fraying of wires, and other issues that could compromise the safety and functionality of your equipment. If you notice any of these problems, it's important to address them immediately to prevent further damage and ensure the safety of your employees and customers.

In addition to inspecting your power cords, it's also a good idea to check your electrical equipment for any signs of wear and tear. This includes checking all plugs, sockets, and switches to ensure they are in good working order. You should also inspect any extension cords or adapters you use for signs of damage and replace them if necessary.

Another important step in preparing your outdoor electrical equipment for the spring season is to check your grounding. This is especially important if you're working with high voltage equipment or running generators. Make sure all grounding wires are properly connected and in good condition, and that you have adequate grounding rods in place.

Finally, it's important to keep your electrical equipment properly maintained throughout the season. This includes regular cleaning and inspection, as well as addressing any issues that arise promptly. By taking these steps, you can ensure your equipment is in top condition and ready to meet the demands of the spring season.
