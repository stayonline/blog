So what is ORV3?  

**ORV3** is the future of power delivery for high-performance computing and data center infrastructure. The future is available at StayOnline, The Power Cord Company.

**ORV3** stands for **Open Rack Version 3**, which is a specification developed by the [Open Compute Project](https://www.opencompute.org/) (OCP) for next-generation data center racks and power infrastructure. ORV3 is designed to address the increasing power, cooling, and scalability demands of high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud data centers.
