The Saf-D-Grid plug and receptacle system, by Anderson Power™, is a unique solution for safe and efficient power delivery. Its versatile and compact design meets international safety requirements for hazardous, low-voltage applications. Compared to other connectors, Saf-D-Grid cords offer higher capacity connections with a small form factor and are capable of running AC or DC power, making them a compelling choice for power system designers to consider.

Saf-D-Grid cords offer more than double the capacity with the same footprint as IEC320 C14/C13 systems. While the highest rating for a C14/C13 power cord is 15A/250V, Saf-D-Grid power cords can carry 32A and 600V. Additionally, C14/C13 is limited to AC power, whereas Saf-D-Grid cords can run both AC and DC.

Saf-D-Grid offers a safe and compact alternative to other form factors with similar specs, such as hefty IEC309 plugs and connectors. It is the only connector system at this size that meets UL 950 and IEC 60950 safety requirements for hazardous, low-voltage applications. It uses an integral latch to prevent inadvertent disconnects and has a first-mate, last-break ground contact design that provides a safe ground path before load-bearing contact is made.

### Key Features

- **Compact & Versatile**
    - Small footprint, ideal for hazardous low-voltage applications.
    - Supports both AC and DC power.
- **High Capacity**
    - Handles 32A and 600V.
    - Over 2x the capacity of IEC320 C14/C13 systems.
- **Enhanced Safety**
    - Meets UL 950 and IEC 60950 standards.
    - Integral latch prevents accidental disconnects.
    - "First mate, last break" ground contact ensures safe grounding.

### Why Choose Saf-D-Grid?

- **Outperforms IEC320 C14/C13:**
    - **C14/C13:** 15A/250V, AC only
    - **Saf-D-Grid:** 32A/600V, AC & DC
- More compact than IEC309 plugs with similar specifications.

### Ideal Applications

- Designed for hazardous low-voltage systems.
- Power systems requiring compact, high-capacity connectors.
- AC or DC Systems
