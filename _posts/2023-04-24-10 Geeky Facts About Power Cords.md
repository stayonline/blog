At StayOnline, we eat, breathe, drink and dream [power cords](https://www.stayonline.com/category/c-molded-power-cords.asp). Power cords may seem like a mundane topic, but there's more to them than meets the eye. They are essential components of our daily lives, connecting our devices to the electrical power grid. In this blog post, we'll explore ten geeky facts about power cords that you may not have known before.

1. A cord by any other name. Power cords are also known as power cables, electrical cables, electrical cords, and power leads. No matter the name, the function is the same. Power cords are used to carry electrical power from a power source to a device that needs it.
2. North American power cords use “S” jackets such as SJT and SVT, while countries in other locations use harmonized jackets (typically beginning with H05VV).
3. The “V” in SVT stands for vacuum, as these lighter duty cords were originally designed for vacuum cleaners as they are more flexible and can bend around furniture.
4. Power cords come in different shapes and sizes, depending on the region and the voltage of the electrical system. For example, in the United States (125V), power cords typically have a plug with two flat blades (sometimes referred to as the Edison plug), while in Europe (240V), they usually have two round pins with a female ground port (known as Shuko style).
5. Power cords are rated based on their current carrying capacity and voltage. The current carrying capacity is measured in amperes (A) and the voltage in volts (V).
6. The thickness of a power cord's wires determines its current carrying capacity. The thicker the wires, the more current it can carry.
7. Power cords can be shielded or unshielded. Shielded power cords have a metal layer that helps to reduce electromagnetic interference, while unshielded power cords do not.
8. Power cords can be detachable or non-detachable. Detachable power cords can be removed from the device, while non-detachable power cords are permanently attached.
9. The length of the power cord affects the amperage; thicker gauges are needed for applications over 50 feet in length.
10. Power cords can be polarized or non-polarized. Polarized power cords have one blade that is wider than the other, to ensure that the plug is inserted correctly into the power outlet.

So, there you have it. Ten geeky facts about power cords. From the plug to the connector, from the jacket to the conductor, StayOnline knows this stuff inside and out, so you don’t have to.
