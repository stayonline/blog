Ensuring business continuity starts with making sure you are taking care of your IT. Businesses, all businesses, are highly dependent on their IT. This year the global budget for business IT is expected to be about $3.92 trillion. Protecting your IT investment starts with a good IT maintenance plan. Every functioning part of your system, from C15 power cords to your mainframe, needs care.
