2024 is upon us and that means it is time for plenty of prediction posts.Â  Here are our 2024 (not so) bold power cord predictions.

1. **Copper will be the conductor of choice.**  
    Same as it ever was, copper will be the preferred conductor of choice for power cord construction. Beware, as always, cheap cords with aluminum wiring as it is weaker and has lower conductivity.
2. **Color cords popularity will continue to grow.**  
    [Color cords](https://www.stayonline.com/category/c-c14-to-c13-color-cords.asp) will continue to be the best option to identify redundant power paths and critical cords. And let's face it, a splash of color makes your datacenter or server rack look just that much cooler.
3. **Cords over 100 feet will still require special UL consideration.**  
    When length increases, ampacity decreases. This is a law of physics and 2024 will see physics remain the same. [Standard UL cords will be capped at 100 feet](https://www.stayonline.com/blog/cord-length-vs-amperage.asp).
4. **Power cords will still be overlooked.**  
    When planning your datacenter, it's always been easy to overlook the mundane power cord, even though it is mission critical. The power cord will still be the unsung hero in 2024.
5. **Jacket options will remain unchanged.**  
    SJT will still be thicker than SVT. [LSZH](https://www.stayonline.com/category/c-lszh-data-center-cords.asp) will still be required in areas where smoke inhalation is a concern. Harmonized jackets will still be required for global applications while SJT and SVT will continue to be the jackets of choice in the US. Additionally, a W jacket will still be required for wet locations.
6. **NEMA designations will remain unchanged.**  
    Bold, we know, but the [NEMA designations](https://www.stayonline.com/product-resources/nema-straight-blade-reference-chart.asp) will remain the same in 2024. The 5-15 will still be 125V/15A at the end of the year, and it will still be the common plug in U.S. households.
7. **Angled cords will still be a great option.**  
    When routing cords in tight spaces and for optimal cable management, [angled cords](https://www.stayonline.com/category/c-c14-to-c13-angled-cords.asp) will serve the purpose perfectly.
8. **Users will still need adapters.**  
    Let's face it, mistakes happen, and you may find yourself with a C19 cord and a C14 inlet. [Block and pigtail adapters](https://www.stayonline.com/category/i-plug-adapters.asp) will still be in demand for situations when you have the wrong cord on hand.
9. **Locking cords will still be in high demand.**  
    Nothing is worse than unexpected power interruptions, especially when that interruption was caused by a loose power cord that could have been prevented by using a [locking power cord](https://www.stayonline.com/category/locking-data-center-cords.asp). Locking power cords will remain a go-to component in mission-critical, high-availability scenarios.
10. **And finally, StayOnline will remain your go-to source for all things power cord.**
