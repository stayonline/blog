Power cables are important, if not critical, tools in certain industries. In fact, they're crucial in sustaining numerous industries around the world. In this blog, we'll be reviewing three industries where custom power cables are making a difference. Let's get started.
### Information Technology

The information technology (IT) industry relies heavily on custom power cables and other types of custom cables. Custom power cables offer the unique advantage of eliminating cable waste. Custom power cables ensure that there are no live wires in use and that each electronic component of a computer or server is powered adequately. Data centers and server rooms are places where you'll certainly see custom power cables in use. Other custom cables used in this industry include custom cables for fiber optics, as well. These cables are particularly useful for dealing with issues such as standard cable patch failure.
### Medical

It might not seem this way at first, but the medical industry has some incredibly specific requirements for wiring and cable assembly. Custom cables help make sure that every piece of medical equipment being used in a research facility, private practice, or hospital is functioning as intended. MRI machines, autoclaves, and patient care tools can all benefit from custom power cables for maximum functionality. These instruments require cable maintenance, as well. Sterilizing equipment, for instance, can make cables degenerate faster than normal as a result of extreme temperature and humidity levels. A custom cable setup may be beneficial in that it could last longer to power this type of equipment.
### Military

Field unit communication, powering overseas bases, and data security are all reliant on custom cable assemblies. Custom power cables make sure that bases have power and communications capabilities even in the harshest conditions. From sandstorms to monsoons, a custom power cable will help keep clear lines of communication open in the field. Custom cables can also make it possible to manage several functions under a single cable, which is an important measure for applications like security.

Custom power cables are utilized in ways the ordinary person might not expect, but they often do power the world around us.
