![What is YY Wire Graphic](/assets/images/posts/why-yy-wire.jpg)Why YY wire?  Say that three times fast.  YY wire - certified for use in India - isn't widely known. Let's break down what it is and why it matters. 

YY wire, consisting of copper conductors in PVC insulation with a PVC jacket, has traditionally been used as industrial control cable, but today, it is the certified choice for use in Indian data centers.

YY wire is India's current standard for wiring to be certified for use in data centers. StayOnline's [BIS Cords](https://www.stayonline.com/BIS-Power-Cords) use YY wire that has been certified by India's [Bureau of Indian Standards](https://www.bis.gov.in/the-bureau/about-bis/), the National Standards Body of India, established under the BIS Act of 2016.

BIS certification ensures high-quality, reliable products that meet strict safety standards—critical for both domestic use and global trade.
