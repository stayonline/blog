In today's mission critical environments, ensuring secure power connections is crucial. A loose connection can easily disrupt normal operations. While locking power cords are the go-to option, they represent a significant investment, especially if you're already equipped with a substantial inventory of standard cords. This is where the challenge lies: the tolerance specifications for standard IEC power cords allow for enough variation that loose connections are a not-so-uncommon headache.

Enter SecureSleeves: the innovative, cost-effective solution designed to upgrade your existing power cords. These molded sleeves act as a shim, ensuring a snugger, more secure fit for both male and female connections across various types, including C13/C15/C14 and C19/C20. With SecureSleeves, you can easily retrofit your current power cords without the need for a complete overhaul. Plus, with a range of color options and immediate availability, StayOnline provides a ready-to-ship solution that seamlessly blends with your existing setup.

## Easy Installation: Retrofitting Made Simple

One of the standout features of SecureSleeves is their ease of installation, making them an ideal solution for businesses looking to upgrade their power cords without extensive downtime or technical complexities. Here's how simple it is to retrofit your existing cords:

1. **Select the Right Size**: Choose the appropriate SecureSleeve size based on your existing power cord type – be it C13/C15/C14 or C19/C20.
2. **Slide and Secure**: Gently slide the SecureSleeve over the end of your power cord. The design ensures a smooth, snug fit without the need for tools or additional hardware.
3. **Instant Upgrade**: Once the SecureSleeve is in place, you’ll immediately notice a firmer connection when you plug in your cord. This simple addition significantly reduces the risk of loose connections and unplanned power disruptions.
4. **Maintenance-Free**: After installation, SecureSleeves require no additional maintenance. They seamlessly become part of your power cord, providing ongoing stability and security.

This hassle-free installation process means you can upgrade an entire room or facility in minimal time, with no special skills required. It’s an efficient, practical solution to create a secure connection.
