StayOnline has long been a [go-to resource](https://www.stayonline.com/Product-Resources/) for those seeking to learn about power cords. Our resource center has been online since the early 2000s and has become a trusted authority for technical information about power cords. Today, we’re expanding on the information found in our [IEC 320 Reference Chart](https://www.stayonline.com/product-resources/reference-iec320.asp).

**IEC 60320**, commonly referred to as _IEC 320_, is a set of international standards that define non-locking[^1] appliance couplers. Published by the International Electrotechnical Commission, IEC 60320 plugs and connectors are widely used in both consumer and commercial electrical equipment. Even if you’ve never heard the term “IEC cord,” you almost certainly use one to power a computer, laptop, printer, or television.

The IEC 320 naming convention is straightforward. All designations begin with the letter **“C”**, followed by a one or two digit number. Odd numbers represent the **female (equipment-side)** connector, while even numbers represent the **male (power-source-side)** plug. In total, there are eleven IEC 60320 connector pairings - some extremely common, others far less so.

You may already recognize several of the shapes shown below, such as **C5/C6**, **C7/C8**, and **C13/C14**.

# Summary

IEC 60320 connectors are a set of standards published by the IEC. They are very common, and chances are you have many in your home or workplace, the most common of which are the C14/C13, C7/C8 and C5/C6 variations. That's all there is to it. Now you know what an IEC connector is, as well as information about the various types.

[^1]: While the standard is for non-locking devices couplers, many locking options are available on the market. See [https://www.stayonline.com/category/locking-data-center-cords.asp](https://www.stayonline.com/category/locking-data-center-cords.asp) for locking variants.
