Today is National Inventors' Day in the U.S. and we at StayOnline can think of none other to honor, than the man himself, Mr. Thomas Edison. Without him, there would be no power cord. In fact, the North American 5-15 is often called an Edison plug, a holdover from the early days of the newfangled electrical outlet.

**Fun fact: February 11 was proclaimed to be National Inventors' Day by Ronald Reagan in 1983 in order to honor the birthday of Thomas Alva Edison, born on February 11, 1847, in Milan, Ohio.**

Edison's relentless pursuit of innovation and his countless contributions to the world of electricity laid the foundation for much of what we now take for granted. His invention of the practical incandescent light bulb not only brought illumination into homes and businesses but also sparked the need for safe and reliable electrical connections. The North American 5-15 plug, often referred to as the Edison plug, traces its origins back to the very beginnings of electrical standardization—a testament to his lasting impact. *

* While the design and safety features of the 5-15 are not directly tied to Edison, they were shaped by the need for compatibility with the electrical systems and voltage standards that Edison helped pioneer. Therefore, while Edison didn’t design the 5-15, his work laid the groundwork for the standard’s existence.
