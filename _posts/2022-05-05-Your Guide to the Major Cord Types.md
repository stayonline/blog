In this day and age, it's not only unwise to lag behind on technological trends, it can actually be detrimental to the success of your company. Currently, about 44% of all businesses have plans to accelerate their digital revamps – if they haven’t done so already. This is due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced countless workers to move from office environments to work-from-home settings. In order to keep things flowing smoothly with their employees and customers, the pandemic taught business owners that they needed to be up to date.

Of the many lessons learned over the past two years, a lot of business discovered that they were overdue in upping their knowledge of power cords.  Taken for granted more often than not, there is more to the average (and often not so average) power cord than initially meets the eye. What’s more, there are many different types of power cords on the market. A custom power cord company can help you navigate this complex and confusing world.

Following is a list of the most common types of cords used in business settings, whether in a corporate office or a home office.

### IEC 60320

IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) power cords are designed to meet international standards; and they work with appliances that reach up to 250 volts and are the most common type of power cord found in data centers. While there are plenty of power cord types across the world, controlled by the standards of individual nations, most countries recognize the standards met by IEC 60320.

### NEMA

NEMA (National Electrical Manufacturers Association) power cords are most used in North America and carry unique pin positions based upon amperage and voltage. NEMA designations are based on a two-part code where the numbers before the dash represent voltage and wires and the numbers after the dash represent amperage. For example, the "5" in the common NEMA 5 15 represents 3-Wire 125V and the "15" represents 15 amp.

### Locking Power Cords

Locking power cords can prevent costly downtime from inadvertent disconnects by securing connections between the PDU and the server/switch. Locking power cords can have either IEC 60320 or NEMA plug/connector configurations.

### Hospital Grade Cords

Hospital grade cords are characterized by a heavier and stronger ground pin, and the retention force for live and neutral pins is much greater than that of standard cords. A separate ring clamp inside the mold is present, which enhances the wire retention force. Prong blades are solid brass construction; there is no folded material. Hospital Grade cords withstand tough conditions and are identified by a green dot.

### Splitter Power Cords

Splitter power cords expand the number of powered devices to 2, 3, 4, or 5 legs from a single male plug. Splitter power cords can have either IEC 60320 or NEMA plug/connector configurations.  They are ideal for distributing power in confined spaces and providing a more aesthetic installation. Legs can be staggered, and connector types can be mixed if rated for the same voltage.

### Conclusion
