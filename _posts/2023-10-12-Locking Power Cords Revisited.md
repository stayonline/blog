StayOnline has always been your one stop shop for all things power cord, and locking cords are no exception.

In addition to the P, W, Z, and A cords that we mentioned in our [previous post](https://www.stayonline.com/blog/our-guide-to-locking-power-cords.asp) related to locking power cords, we also have Dual-Lock, IEC Lock, V-Lock, S-Lock and SecureLock (Raritan) power cords.

### Locking Cords

Whether it be C20 or C14 male ends or C13, C15, and C19 female ends, StayOnline has the locking power cord solution to meet your mission critical needs.

- [C20 Locking Cords](https://www.stayonline.com/category/c-c20-locking-data-center-cords.asp)

As a reminder, the phrase "_Proprietary Way_" is a good way to remember which solutions are proprietary and which are not. P-Lock and W-Lock are proprietary cords, while A-Lock (WS-Lock) and Z-Lock are universal solutions.

Use Z-Lock or Dual-Lock if you need to lock both ends of the cord in place.

SecureLock, P-Lock, and Dual-Lock are for ServerTech, Raritan, Vertiv, Knurr and NextGen Eaton equipment.

W-Lock is for Schneider/APC, Panduit, Enlogic and NextGen HP power gear.

A-Lock (WS-Lock) and Z-Lock are universal solutions. Z-Lock locks both ends of the connection in place while A-Lock (WS-Lock) locks only the female end in place.
