At StayOnline, we believe that taking care of our community goes hand-in-hand with taking care of our planet. This month, we were proud to put that belief into action by donating **45 desktop PCs, 5 servers, 7 laptops, and 27 monitors** to the **Kramden Institute**, a nonprofit dedicated to bridging the digital divide through technology access and education.

With the help of Kramden and their incredible mission, yesterday’s hardware is becoming _tomorrow’s opportunity_ and that opportunity is now in the hands of students, families, and adult learners across North Carolina.

## **Recycling With Purpose**

By putting our decommissioned systems back into circulation, we’re reducing e-waste, and lowering our environmental footprint. Every device that can be refurbished, reused, or repurposed is one less item ending up in a landfill.

Our donation supports sustainable reuse of hardware and a more circular, greener technology ecosystem. Recycling these machines is part of our commitment to doing right by the environment we all share.

## **Strengthening the Community Through Access**

Kramden Institute’s work reaches well beyond recycling / redistribution of computers.  In addition to providing low or no cost computers to students and individuals who may otherwise not have digital access, they also provide digital literacy training for people in our community who can use those skills to better their career paths.

Our equipment donation directly fuels these programs, enabling Kramden to put reliable technology into the hands of North Carolinians who rely on it for education, skill-building, and staying connected.

This is where sustainability meets community: previously unused technology is now helping people build futures, not just filling a storage rooms.

## **A Greener Future Starts Locally**

As a company rooted in North Carolina, we’re proud to invest back into our local community. These donations are part of our long-term effort to:

- Reduce waste inside our own operations
- Support organizations dedicated to environmental stewardship
- Lead with actions that match our values

We’re grateful for the work Kramden Institute does every day and thankful for the opportunity to play a small part in expanding their impact.

## **Looking Ahead**

This donation represents just one step.  We will continue seeking out meaningful ways to reduce waste, reuse materials responsibly, and strengthen the communities that support us.
