When purchasing standard power cords, user options can be limited. Many power cords are available only in standard lengths, cord sizes and plug configurations. In many cases, this makes custom power cords a superior choice compared to standard power cords across a wide range of industries and applications.

The need for custom power cords arises because the demands of different industries and applications vary. A power cord that is ideal for a construction site application may not be best for hospital equipment or a wet environment. The use of power cords that do not meet the specifications of an application can have a significant impact on performance, safety and the longevity of equipment.

### Basic Advantages

With custom power cords, each cord is specifically designed and manufactured with a certain application in mind. Some of the parameters and features available when designing a custom power cord include being able to specify the gauge of wiring, length, amperage, the number of connectors, sealed plug designs for wet applications and color-coded cords for construction sites or data centers. Custom power cords can also include surge protectors to guard against potentially dangerous power surges.

When discussing custom power cords, "custom" means that the cords can either be hand assembled or over molded for an application. It is important to know the specifications, limitations and challenges associated with an application before engaging a knowledgeable custom power cord manufacturer, but overall, many users agree that custom power cords offer far better performance, safety and longevity.

### More Flexibility

Buying custom cords means getting the right cord the first time, rather than compromising specifications based on what is in stock at the local supplier. There is also a great deal more flexibility offered when purchasing custom power cords from a manufacturer like StayOnline.

Whether using hand-assembled or over-molded products, the 3 chief advantages of using custom power cords include:

1. **Higher quality:** Attention to detail, overseen by engineers, ensures compliance with Underwriters Laboratories (UL) and all other applicable governing bodies. You are protected from getting a cord of inferior quality that may or may not meet applicable quality and safety standards. When using a reputable supplier, all custom power cords are made to IPC quality standards.
2. **Smaller order sizes:** Building custom often means that you will be dealing with no MOQ's, or minimum order quantities. Ordering only what you need saves money and is more efficient. It also ensures that you will pay the right price per cord.
3. **Shorter lead times:** Since you are working directly with the manufacturer, you are essentially booking time directly on their equipment, and getting your cords as soon as they are finished. You'll know exactly when the order will be produced, and that your custom power cords will be shipped directly to your specified destination.

These advantages apply to any type of custom power cord:

- Power stringers
- Portable outlet boxes
- Assembled indoor or outdoor cords
- Overhead electrical drops
- Molded power cords
- Molded splitter cords

There are many options available when it comes to custom power cords, and the best way to ensure that you include all of the features necessary to make your custom power cord a perfect fit is to engage a trusted, knowledgeable custom power cord manufacturer.
