## ALDER Capital Partners and StayOnline team to continue the thirty-year old manufacturer’s pursuit of customer service and quality in the power cord industry.

Henderson, NC – October 15, 2021 – [StayOnline](https://www.stayonline.com/), a leading provider of power cables and plug adapters, recently announced the grand opening of a new, state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Henderson, North Carolina.  The new UL-Certified facility incorporates improvements designed to increase order processing and production capabilities with a focus on customer service and quality.

StayOnline provides the largest selection of in-stock power cords, wiring devices, and custom production capabilities to the mission-critical, temporary power, medical, OEM, and manufacturing markets.  StayOnline’s vision is to meet the challenges of providing both legacy and cutting-edge cord technologies in a competitive global environment.

“We are dedicated to being the singular power cord provider able to custom-assemble or injection-mold products that meet the needs of the marketplace,” states Hal Mahler, VP of Products at StayOnline.  “By leveraging new manufacturing processes that are supported by the latest technology, we are able to provide cords that meet the quantities and specifications required by our customers.”

StayOnline has the capability to mold over one million variations of NEMA and IEC 320 standard plugs and receptacles, making it able to meet the demands of a global power cord market as well.  StayOnline was acquired by ALDER Capital Partners in April of this year, becoming part of a portfolio of strategic long-term investments.

“Our interest in StayOnline,” notes Ankur Chatterjee, Managing Partner at ALDER Capital Partners and President at StayOnline, “rested on their ability to continue to support clients globally.  Through investments in technology and manufacturing, we believe the company is even better poised to continue to lead in its market segments.”

One key to the investment in StayOnline was the company’s ability to focus on customer service and quality.

“At the end of the day, our goal is to ensure that every cord customer receives the product they require, on-time and on-budget,” states Mahler.  “Our new facility and relationship with ALDER will enable us to improve on satisfying the needs of our customers in a demanding global power cord market. From mission critical to life safety, our electrical and mechanical engineers support applications that must also have the highest quality.”  ALDER Capital’s investment in StayOnline ensures the company has the tools and resources it needs to look forward to another 30 years of service to the power cord industry.
