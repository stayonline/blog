### _How custom power cords helped a customer upgrade their data center with Open Compute racks where 480v power is not available_

Open Compute Project (OCP) hardware promises incredible density, efficiency, and serviceability. But anyone working hands-on in real data centers knows a simple truth:

**Some facilities are not fully “high power-ready.” Don’t let your gray space limit your white space.**

A recent project proved the point. A customer wanted to deploy **OCP ORv3 power shelves**—48kVA rack power with hyperscale-grade performance—but their data center wasn’t fully modernized. No 480V distribution typical of the OCP ecosystem. Just a standard **North-American 120/208V environment**.

Instead of delaying their deployment or redesigning the facility, StayOnline helped them bridge the gap by building the missing piece:  
**custom-configured 208V power cords tailored to ORv3 power shelf requirements.**

## **Why the Challenge Exists**

ORv3 power shelves are commonly fed from:

- 3-phase 380–415V AC in European and hyperscale designs
- Or 277/480V AC in modern U.S. facilities

But in a lot of legacy or mixed-use buildings, the available supply is **208V 3-phase.** This mismatch can cause undersized input current for the shelf’s peak rating.

## **Our Solution: 208V Cordsets for ORv3 Shelves**

We engineered **208V-rated cord assemblies** that matched the ORv3 AC connection standard. This let the customer power ORv3 shelves using their existing electrical panels _without_ needing to install:

- New 415V service
- Step-up transformers
- New PDUs
- Or any interim facility upgrades

In other words:  **OCP-class rack power, delivered through the infrastructure they already had.**

## **Why Custom Matters in Transitional Deployments**

Every data center modernization happens in phases. ORv3 is no exception.

Custom cabling helps when the facility isn’t yet running 480V. You can start deploying OCP racks today instead of waiting for the electrical upgrade.

---

## **The Result: A Clean, Scalable Path to OCP Adoption**

The customer deployed their ORv3 shelves on schedule, inside their legacy 208V environment, with no electrical redesign. As they move further into OCP hardware, the cords we supplied become part of a long-term strategy: deploy now, upgrade facility infrastructure later. Smart transitions like this are how modern data centers evolve—incrementally, pragmatically, and without disruption.

## **Takeaway**

OCP isn’t just for greenfield hyperscale builds. It’s absolutely deployable in real-world, mixed-voltage, brownfield environments. All you need are the right components connecting the two worlds. If you’re exploring ORv3 or other OCP integrations—and your facility isn’t fully ready—we can help engineer the exact power connectivity you need.
