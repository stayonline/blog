Power cords allow us to do incredible things on a daily basis. That said, it's easy to use power cords without realizing just how different they can be from one another. With that in mind, we're here to review a few differences between the C13 power cord and C15 power cords. Let's get started.
### Notch or No Notch?

One of the most noticeable differences between C13 and C15 power cord connectors is the notch on the C15. Though the two connectors do look remarkably similar from a distance, one small notch sets them apart from one another. The C15 has a small groove that runs perpendicular to the ground terminal. This means that C15 cords can work with C16 outlets. One small feature really makes a world of difference when you're comparing these two power cords to one another.
### Temperature Rating

Another key difference between C13 and C15 connectors is their temperature ratings. This is one of the most important differentiating factors between these two power cords. A higher temperature rating gives the C15 power cord the ability to effectively power high-temperature devices like servers, computing network closets, and more. The C15 cord has a temperature rating up to 120 degrees Celsius while the C13 cord only has a temperature rating up to 65 degrees Celsius. That means any high-temperature devices you want to power, even something as simple as an electric kettle, require a C15 cord.
### Applications

As we touched on above, C13 and C15 power cords have different temperature ratings. This means that they have fundamentally different applications. C13 cords are typically used for devices like PCs, printers, monitors, and amplifiers. C15 power cords, on the other hand, are used for things like servers and POE switches in computing networking closets and sever rooms.  In other words, they're designed for a more substantial power loads and applications with high temperatures.

Choosing the right cord is a matter of learning what differentiates it from other power cords and putting each cord to its proper use. Make sure you do your research before picking a power cord at random.
