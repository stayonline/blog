As part of our ongoing commitment to U.S. manufacturing and secure supply chains, StayOnline is expanding our **TAA-compliant** power-cord offering to include new **ORV3 (Open Rack V3) power assemblies** - all **custom-made in our North Carolina factory**.

This expansion supports hyperscale operators, government buyers, and integrators who require both **TAA compliance** and **next-generation server-rack standards**.

## **Why TAA Matters**

The **Trade Agreements Act (TAA)** restricts government procurement to products made in the U.S. or designated countries.  For federal agencies, government-affiliated data centers, and defense-related integrators, TAA compliance is not optional.

StayOnline maintains a dedicated line of **TAA-compliant power cords**, produced in our **North Carolina, USA** facility, where we terminate connectors on U.S. wire.

## **Introducing TAA-Compliant ORV3 Power Assemblies**

Hyperscale data centers are accelerating adoption of OCP infrastructure across the full rack topography.

By offering **ORV3 power cords with TAA compliance**, StayOnline becomes one of the few U.S. manufacturers capable of supporting:

- Government-affiliated hyperscale environments    
- Defense and aerospace IT infrastructure    
- Data centers with strict compliance requirements    
- Integrators building to ORV3 specifications    
- Contractors needing _regulatory alignment_
## **Made in North Carolina - Built for Modern Data Centers**


With ORV3 included in our TAA lineup, customers can now consolidate purchasing while maintaining U.S.-manufactured compliance across their entire rack-power ecosystem.
