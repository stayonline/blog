Over the past two years, the supply of goods (and services) to and within the US has been drastically altered. This is due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, but one can also look to delays in the supply chain—namely, the import of goods from China. The resulting supply chain crisis has impacted both consumers and businesses alike, with delays rippling through the economy as projects are forced to extend their lead times. We have seen intervals on obtaining components and stock cords go from 2–4 weeks to as much as 38 weeks or longer.

### **Background**

The dilemma is that many of the businesses we support simply can't wait. Project delays mean revenue delays, which is unacceptable. “Don’t worry about paying us back,” said no bank, ever. And so, the task of keeping businesses on track is heightened in today’s market. We are on a new playing field, and that requires new plays. One such play that addresses the quandary of longer lead times is the custom building of power cords at our manufacturing facility in North Carolina.

### **How Are Custom Power Cords Made?**

The process of manufacturing a power cord—whether it is completely custom or just a “stock” cord with a few modifications—begins when a customer has specific demands and power cord needs. Customers have two ways of reaching out to StayOnline to get the process started. One of the most convenient ways is to use the custom [CordBuilder™](https://www.stayonline.com/cordbuilder/) tool on the StayOnline website. This tool allows customers to generate a bill of materials and a quote for the custom cords they need—with the customization they want, and in the quantities they are looking for. Another option is to reach out to our sales department to discuss your order and the specifics you desire. We’re here to help!

### **What Should I Know When Ordering a Custom Extension Cord?**

For starters, you will need to have an idea of the kind of cord you are after—whether it is a custom power stringer, a portable outlet box, for indoor or outdoor use, a molded cord, or a splitter. Once you know what type of cord you need, StayOnline’s [CordBuilder™](https://www.stayonline.com/cordbuilder/) tool will walk you through the process of getting the cord specified and made. Required information includes the type of plug and connector you need, jacket type (based on the connector and plug), and the color and length of the cord itself. The online tool shows you images of your selections every step of the way to ensure you are getting exactly what you have in mind.

And for a second opinion, you can always reach out to us here at StayOnline. We’d be happy to guide you through the process.
