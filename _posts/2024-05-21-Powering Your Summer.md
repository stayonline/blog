Summertime is fast approaching and that means an uptick in workloads for lighting and staging production companies. StayOnline has the products you need for safe and efficient power connections for event power. From Cam-Lock (Single Pole) plugs and connectors, to Edison type cords, to custom power cords built to your exact specifications, StayOnline has your back.

## Cam-Locks

Cam-Locks, also known as single pole plugs and connectors, offer a quick _and safe_ way to connect and disconnect the power source in stage settings. Single pole plugs and connectors are often used in lighting setups that require high power, such as in stage lighting for concerts and theatrical productions.

StayOnline has a wide breadth of single pole cam lock devices available.

Cam-Lock connectors, often referred to as cam and groove couplings, are widely used in various industries for their efficiency in making quick and secure connections for high-current power applications. Here are some technical details about Cam-Lock connectors that highlight their design and functionality:

1. **Design and Construction:** Cam-Lock connectors consist of a male (plug) and a female (receptacle) end. The male end has a groove that is secured by the cams on the female end when pushed together and turned. This simple locking mechanism ensures a stable and secure connection without the need for additional tools.
2. **Electrical Specifications:** Cam-Lock connectors are designed to handle high currents, typically ranging from 100 to 400 amps, which makes them ideal for large-scale power distribution tasks. They can operate at a range of voltages, often up to 600 volts AC, accommodating the power needs of substantial electrical systems.
3. **Safety Features:** Safety is a critical component of Cam-Lock design. Many connectors come with insulating covers to prevent accidental contact with live circuits. Color coding is another common feature, aiding in the correct matching of cables to ensure proper electrical phasing.
4. **Size and Configuration:** Cam-Locks are available in various sizes, typically ranging from 1/2 inch to 4 inches, to accommodate different diameter cables and varying current capacities. The configuration can be straight, 90 degrees, or with a T-split, depending on the application's needs.
5. **Applications:** Beyond event power, Cam-Lock connectors are used in industrial settings, including generators, sound and lighting equipment, and temporary electrical installations. They are valued for their robustness and ease of use in quick-change settings.

These features make Cam-Lock connectors a reliable choice for applications requiring quick, safe, and effective power connections, particularly in high-demand environments like those encountered in staging and lighting production.

## Edison and Stage Lighting Power Cords and Components

Event and stage power also frequently use the humble NEMA 5-15, known in the theater world as the "Edison". The Edison is the common USA household plug. StayOnline has them in all black which is ideal for behind-the-scenes usage for a theatrical production.

Edison cords and components are integral to stage lighting setups, offering versatility and reliability. Here are some key technical details:

1. **Design and Structure:** Edison power cords, often referred to as "Edison cords," feature a two or three-prong plug (NEMA 1-15P or 5-15P) on one end and a corresponding socket or a bare end on the other. They are typically used for standard 120V AC power distribution, which is common in residential and commercial environments in North America.
2. **Gauge and Rating:** The wire gauge in Edison cords is crucial for determining the maximum current the cord can safely handle. Common gauges are 12, 14, and 16 AWG (American Wire Gauge), with 12 AWG supporting up to 20 amps, making it suitable for higher power requirements. The choice of gauge depends on the power demands and length of the cord, as longer cords may experience a voltage drop.
3. **Materials:** The insulation and jacket materials of Edison cords are designed for durability and safety. Common materials include PVC, rubber, and neoprene, which offer varying degrees of flexibility, temperature resistance, and durability against abrasion and chemical exposure.
4. **Connectors and Sockets:** Connectors are typically molded to the cable, providing added durability and safety. For stage applications, heavy-duty connectors with robust housing are preferred to withstand frequent handling and environmental stress. Sockets may include features like spring-loaded covers to protect against dust and moisture.
5. **Safety Compliance:** Edison cords are subject to safety standards and certifications such as UL (Underwriters Laboratories) and ETL (Intertek Testing Services), ensuring they meet specific safety requirements. These include fire and shock hazard tests, ensuring that the cords are safe for use in public and professional environments.
6. **Configurations:** Besides standard single-cable configurations, Edison cords can be part of larger assemblies like breakout cables, where one main feeder splits into multiple Edison outlets, commonly used in lighting arrays and equipment setups on stage.
