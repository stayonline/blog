Selecting the appropriate power cord is crucial for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of your equipment. Whether you're setting up a new server rack or organizing your workspace, following these five key steps can help you make the right choice.

#### 1. The Ends

Start by identifying the plug (male side) and connector (female side) that you need. The most common types are:

- **5-15**
- **C13 (or C15 for Cisco)**
- **C14**
- **C19**
- **C20**

#### 2. The Length

While it might seem obvious, determining the correct length of your power cord is essential. Measure the distance between your devices and the power source. Length can be measured in feet or meters, with 6 feet being the most common length inside a rack.

#### 3. The Amp and/or Gauge

The amp and gauge of a power cord are interconnected. If you know one, you typically know the other. The most common specifications are:

- **10 AMP**
- **15 AMP** (backwards compatible)

These specifications ensure your cord can handle the necessary power load without risk.

#### 4. Color

Standard equipment typically comes with a black cord. However, red and blue cords are often used to highlight redundancy and critical connections. Most colors are available to help with organization and identification.

#### 5. Locking

In high-density, mission-critical environments, a locking cord is a must. To suggest the correct locking solution, identify your Power Distribution Unit (PDU) requirements. This ensures that connections remain secure and uninterrupted.

By following these steps, you can easily select the right power cord to meet your needs, ensuring your equipment operates smoothly and safely.
