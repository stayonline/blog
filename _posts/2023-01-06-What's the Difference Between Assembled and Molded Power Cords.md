We're glad you asked. If you are not as versed in all things power cords as we are at StayOnline, you may think that a power cord is a power cord is a power cord. We are here to tell you that not all cords are created equal (or are they?). When it comes to custom power cords, Stay Online produces both hand-terminated assembled cords and custom molded power cords. While they are the same in function, they differ in form and fit and the way they are manufactured. Let's dive into the three key differences.

1. ### **Means of Manufacture**
    
    Assembled cords use hand-terminated plugs and connectors. A special torque driver is used to assure that the proper amount of force is applied to the clamps, resulting in a firm connection without over tightening which could damage the cable.
    
    Custom molded power cords, on the other hand, are created using ultrasonic welds that bind the copper to the terminal. The cord is then put into a molding machine that surrounds the terminals with PVC. The result is a power cord that would look most familiar to your average citizen, like the power cord to your laptop or PC.
    
2. ### **Product Offering**
    
    Because of the inherent modularity of hand-terminated connectors, there are many more configurations available. StayOnline can hand-terminate the full suite of NEMA designations, IEC320 and 309, Stage Pin, CS 50 and 60A cords and more. Hand-terminated cords may also be rated for outdoor use.
    
    Custom molded cords from StayOnline are available with the most common IEC and NEMA 125/250v 10, 15 and 20 amp plugs and connectors. Cords can be molded in 8 distinct colors, which can help you color-code redundant circuits in your data center. Left and right options are available for tight routing of cables.
    
3. ### **Trick Question - They're Not All That Different.**
    
    When it comes to application, safety and quality, all cords are created equal.
    
    Each type of custom cord produced by StayOnline is suitable for the application for which it was built. A NEMA 5-15P, the household Edison plug that we are familiar with in the US, is a NEMA 5-15P whether it is hand-terminated or molded. There is no functional difference between hand-terminated and molded power cords.
    
    All cords may be UL listed and are put through the same rigors of dialectic strength and Hi-Pot testing. As an added safety measure, all configurations are vetted by our engineering team prior to construction.
    
    After construction, our quality inspects each cord as it is carefully packed and shipped out the door.
    

So, there you have it and now you know the differences between hand-terminated and custom molded power cords. Each type is manufactured using a different process and there are different options available, but both kinds are suitable for a given application and are manufactured to the same high quality and safety standards.
