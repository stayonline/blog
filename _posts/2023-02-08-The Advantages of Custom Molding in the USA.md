As a business, consider the origin and production of your products, especially when it comes to custom cords. Buying American-made custom cords can offer numerous benefits. Buying cords that are molded in the USA supports the local economy, offers the opportunity to customize the cords to your exact specifications, and can be an excellent choice when fast turnaround is needed.

1. Support Local
    
    First and foremost, buying power cords that are molded in the USA supports the local economy and helps create jobs for American workers. This has a positive impact on the economy and helps foster a sense of community and pride. Cords molded by StayOnline are molded by American workers at our plant in Henderson NC.
    
2. Customization
    
    Customize your cords to meet your specific needs by buying custom cords molded in the USA. Buying from an American company enables you to work with the manufacturer and create cords tailored to your exact specifications, including color, length, and type of connector. Products made overseas often do not offer this level of customization.
    
3. Fast Turnaround
    
    Faster turnaround times and improved customer service often result from buying American-made products. American manufacturers, known for their responsiveness and ease of work, make the process of ordering and receiving custom cords more efficient and less stressful.
    

In conclusion, there are many benefits to buying custom cords molded in the USA. From supporting the local economy and ensuring high quality, to the ability to customize and faster turnaround times, American-made custom cords can offer several advantages over those made overseas. So next time you are in the market for custom cords, consider buying ones that are made right here in the USA.
