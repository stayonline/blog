## **What’s a CAGE Code anyway?**

If you’re in the business of supplying products like power cords and assemblies to the U.S. government, there’s one detail you can’t overlook: the **CAGE Code**.

StayOnline’s CAGE Code: **1VQR9**

A **CAGE Code** (Commercial and Government Entity Code) is a unique five-character ID that tells the federal government, _“Hey, we’re a legit supplier and you can trust us.”_ It’s issued by the **Defense Logistics Agency (DLA)** and acts like a backstage pass to federal contracts, procurement systems, and defense logistics.

### **Why It Matters in the Power Cord Supply Chain**

1. **Want to Sell to the Government? You’ll Need It.**  
    If you’re bidding on a Department of Defense contract or supplying cords to a GSA schedule, a CAGE Code is a must-have. It shows you're cleared to do business with federal agencies.
2. **It Keeps the Supply Chain Running Smoothly.**  
    Agencies rely on CAGE Codes to track suppliers, manage inventory, process payments, and verify that orders - like a batch of custom-length power cords - come from a verified source.
3. **It’s a Compliance Box Checked.**  
    If your products end up in overseas bases or are governed by **ITAR** (International Traffic in Arms Regulations), the CAGE Code helps you stay on the right side of trade compliance.
4. **It’s Required for SAM.gov.**  
    To even get on the radar of federal buyers through **SAM.gov**, you need an active CAGE Code. No code? No contract.
5. **It Builds Trust.**  
    In federal supply chains, especially when reliability matters (like powering mission-critical equipment), a CAGE Code signals your business is credible and ready for high-stakes logistics.

### **Bottom Line**

In the world of government logistics, where traceability, accountability, and compliance are non-negotiable, a CAGE Code isn’t just red tape, it shows that a company like StayOnline is plugged into the federal supply chain and ready for business.
