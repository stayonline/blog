Custom power cords are essential to any business' infrastructure because they help provide power across various applications—from powering laptop batteries and charging phones to powering servers and data centers. With the ongoing digital transformation, businesses are continually looking for ways to improve their processes. COVID-19 was responsible for a significant acceleration in digital transformation, with 44% of businesses either planning to pick up the pace of digitization or having already been digitalized as a result of the pandemic, according to _Finance Online._

For all of this upgraded equipment to function correctly, it requires the consistent voltage levels provided by custom power cords. Keep reading to learn when you should contact a custom power cord company to address your company’s needs.

### **When Starting a Project**

If you are starting a project or if this is something new for you, it would be best to contact a company that specializes in custom power cords so that they can advise you and weigh in on the planning stages before you actually make any purchases. This way, they can give you an idea of what they think will work best for your needs and help guide you in the right direction.

### **When Procuring New Products**

If you are a repeat client with a power cord vendor with whom you’ve established a relationship, it could be worth contacting them again to see if there have been any significant changes made since the last time you ordered, which might cause challenges with their products. If you're using an older or outdated product and want to stay current, contact your custom power cord company and see if they offer an upgraded version of that custom power cord for your application.

### **When in Doubt…**

If you've ever run across a questionable power cord, you know how important it is to promptly secure a quality replacement. Contact a custom power cord company if any of your power cords become damaged or exposed to extreme temperatures. In many cases, manufacturers will send out replacement parts within a few weeks of an incident.

### **If You Have a Multipurpose Business**

There are many situations where securing custom power cords is essential—for example, if you have a business that requires multiple electrical outlets, different numbers of outlets needed at different times, or if you have many machines in one location. In cases such as these, it is very prudent to consider engaging a custom power cord company.
